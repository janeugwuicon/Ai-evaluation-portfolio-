To get that 100% bypass, we need to strip away the "robotic" perfection and inject some personality, rhythm, and local flavor. AI usually writes in very balanced, predictable sentences. Humans—especially Nigerians—tend to be more direct, sometimes repetitive for emphasis, and use specific idioms.

Here is a humanized, Nigerian-toned version of your project text.

Month 6: The "Sense" Factor (Reasoning & Logic)
Our Yardstick for This Phase:
In this stage, we aren’t just looking at grammar; we are looking for "who get sense." We want to see if the AI can actually think through a problem from start to finish without losing its way.

Follow-Come Consistency: Can the model maintain the same logic from Step A to Step Z? No jumping from "frying pan to fire."

True Logic & "No Wayo": We are checking if the reasoning actually holds water. If it starts contradicting itself, it has failed the test.

Self-Correction (Fixing Front): This one is key. If the AI makes a mistake, can it catch itself and fix it "sharp-sharp" without us having to point it out?

Following Orders Under Pressure: We want to see if it can still follow instructions to the letter, even when the task is heavy and the logic is getting deep.

The Heavy Hitters (Models Used):
To really test the waters, we are putting these two against each other:

The Control: DeepSeek-R1 (The steady hand).

The Challenger: o1-mini (The new kid on the block).

What We Are Watching Closely:
This phase is strictly for the "deep work"—tasks that need proper planning and abstract thinking. We aren’t just looking for the final answer; we are grading the work based on how stable the middle steps are. The goal is simple: Does the model have the "head" to correct its own errors before they even happen?
